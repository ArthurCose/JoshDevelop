# JoshDevelop

JoshDevelop is a web based realtime collaborative editor designed for quick setup. Just run `npm install`, drop a project folder into the "projects" folder, and start a run.* script.

You should be able to access the editor through a web browser pointing to the IP and port of the host machine (http://localhost:8080 to access from the host machine by default)
